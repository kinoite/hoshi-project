# The Hoshi Project
The Hoshi Project is a set of rust-written utilities and frameworks to level up your rust journey.

## What is this for?
This project is for rusteacan newbies looking to improve their rust programs with the framworks and/or utilities in the Hoshi Project, we aim to have a better experience and range of already flexible, powerful, modular frameworks and utilities for Rust without having to make them from scratch.

This project is meant to make Rust program coding less of a headache so newbie rustaceans don't have to write their framework and utilities on their own if they'res no already existing framework or utility.

## *Who* is this project for?
Rustaecan beginners/newbies who just want their program to work without having much of a headache writing frameworks from scratch if one doesn't exist for Rust.

## And who is this project *not* for?
Rustaceans who are willing to make their own framework and utilities from scratch, (possibly causing headaches to them, but who knows?)

## Current frameworks and utilities for now.

### webfetch - powerful, robust and fast wget alternative

### kaika - user-friendlier and more easily understandable alternative to tar

### hoshipkg/hpkg - package manager for the unreleased work-in-progress independent linux distrubution Neutronized Linux (NeutL), for speed, high performance for all hardware a-like

alot of frameworks and utilities are gonna be created and be sent to the Rustacean newbie community, stay tuned!- or not, it's your choice!- teehee~
